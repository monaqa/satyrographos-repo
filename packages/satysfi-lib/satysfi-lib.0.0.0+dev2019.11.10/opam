description: """
DEPRECATED: This package has been renamed with satysfi-base.

This is a collection of utility functions and modules for SATySFi. Because the library bundled with the default installation configuration of SATySFi is currently not rich enough, this project aims to provide a complementary library sufficient for most situations in typesetting.

this requires Satyrographos to install. See https://github.com/na4zagin3/satyrographos.
